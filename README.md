# Thesis UoM in ecosystems artifact

## Project desc
This code artifact has been produced as part of a master's thesis to investigate how an entire ecosystem of code and data resources can handle units of measurement.

The artifact contains functionality to read, as well as create files and tables (data_reader_writer). It also includes functionality (by using a quantities library) to convert units "in file format" to unit types (unitfier), and vice versa.

The artifact also contains code (functionality_example, luggage_example, research_example) and data that exemplify the functionality.
